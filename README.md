## **About TVC Mount**
**I'm planning to model a TVC (Thrust Vector Control) Mount for RocketV2 since using 4 high-torque servos for RocketV1 proved to be unnecessarily heavy. By designing a TVC mount for just 2 servos to control the X and Y axes, I can significantly reduce weight. After realizing the high-torque motors were too bulky.**
>UPDATE: I shifted to a more efficient design with 9g servos. Check out my nearly completed TVC design below.

## **About Manual Controller**
**I coded a manual controller, to test and control the servos with my joystick, making it easier to integrate the limits into the model.**
>I thought it might also be good to have the ability to control it manually in case of emergencies like airbrakes, drag chute for safe landing etc, so I might add more buttons and functions in the future.

## **About Flight Computer**
**As part of my TVC (Thrust Vector Control) RocketV2 project, I've designed a detailed flight computer schematic. The schematic includes connections for an Arduino Nano, MPU6050, and BMP280 sensors. To create this schematic, I had to make some custom .lbr files for the Eagle program, as they aren't available online.**  
>If you're interested in these files, you can find them in the `flightComputer` directory of this repository. Also check schematic (basic outline for now) down below.

## **What am i working on right now?**
**Soldering, assembling, and more. I regularly update this `What am I working on right now?` section, so you can check out the latest progress and final products.**

>This week, I added more modules to the board, including a microSD card adapter to record the maximum altitude. I also added a new buzzer and an RGB LED to ensure the rocket is ready for launch. Additionally, I upgraded from the BMP180 to the BMP280 for improved accuracy. And of course, I threw in a switchâ€”because why not?
